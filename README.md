Package _aspnetusers_ supports access to a user authentication database previously or concurrently used by ASP.NET Core applications.
It helped migrate applications from C# to Go, without requiring users to re-register or reset their passwords;
indeed for a time the two services ran side-by-side, sharing the same authentication database.
